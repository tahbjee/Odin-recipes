    <h3>
      Swedish meatballs, or "k√∂ttbullar" in Swedish, are a popular dish that has
      gained international recognition.
    </h3>
    <p>
      These savory meatballs are traditionally made from a mixture of ground
      meat, often a combination of beef and pork, mixed with breadcrumbs, eggs,
      and various seasonings. The exact recipe can vary, with some regional and
      family variations.

      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk</li>

      <li>Butter or oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare Ingredients: In a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, finely
        chopped onion, breadcrumbs, egg, and milk. Add salt, pepper, allspice,
        and nutmeg to the mixture. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape Meatballs: With your hands, shape the mixture into small, round
        meatballs. The size can vary based on personal preference, but they are
        typically about 1 inch in diameter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook Meatballs: Heat butter or oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place
        the meatballs in the skillet, ensuring they are not too crowded, and
        cook until browned on all sides. This usually takes about 8-10 minutes,
        depending on the size of the meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: Make Gravy: If desired, you can make a simple gravy. Remove
        the meatballs from the skillet and set them aside. In the same skillet,
        add a bit more butter or oil if needed. Stir in flour to create a roux.
        Gradually whisk in beef or vegetable broth until the mixture thickens
        into a gravy. Season with salt and pepper.

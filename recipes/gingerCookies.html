    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk Dry Ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour,
        ground ginger, baking soda, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, and salt.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cream Butter and Sugar: In a large bowl, cream together the softened
        butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Egg and Molasses: Beat in the egg until well combined, and then add
        the molasses. Mix until the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incorporate Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to
        the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional Sugar Coating: If desired, roll tablespoon-sized portions of
        dough into balls and coat them in additional sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place on Baking Sheets: Arrange the cookie dough balls on the prepared
        baking sheets, leaving enough space between each cookie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the
        edges are set but the centers are still soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes
        before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
